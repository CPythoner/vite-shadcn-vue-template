Now that the summer''s almost over we have decided to make a few changes to how we release new content.
1. First of all, all premium episodes will still be released for free on all podcast platforms. 
However, a month after their initial release, they will be removed from the free feed and added to our paid episode archive which will be available on our Patreon page.
For example, an episode released on the 1st of September will be removed from the feed on the 1st of October, etc.
2. After they''re removed from the free feed, those of you who decide that they want to continue having access to our premium episodes (old and new) or have some extra materials to prepare for IELTS can sign up to our Patreon page and binge-listen to all the episodes that we''ve released since 2020 without any interruptions from ads.
3. These changes will allow US to have a more sustainable revenue stream and at the same time will allow YOU to continue listening to all our premium episodes for free ❤️

We think it''s a win-win 🤝

Tune in and have a great day!

The origin of this phrase is a bit unclear, but it''s thought to come from the physical act of bending your body backwards, which can be really hard and uncomfortable. So, when you say someone is "bending over backwards," it''s like saying they''re doing something really hard or uncomfortable to help out or get something done.

You start of good but by the 4th sentence get lost in all these tenses, forget all the topic related vocabulary and just can''t hold it together, really. In addition to this, many of you do not live in English speaking countries and do not get a chance to hear and/or talk about a whole lot of different topics.

Ariel Goodbody introduces each story, explaining difficult vocabulary and talking about their life. Thanks to their high energy and clear pronunciation, the stories are entertaining and simple to understand.

Whether you’re a beginner, intermediate or advanced learner, there’s something for everyone. The stories cover a wide range of genres, such as fairy tales, myths and legends, drama, comedy, romance, horror, science fiction and action. There is a balance of children’s stories, as well as more mature themes for adults. While listening to the stories, you can read the transcript at EasyStoriesInEnglish.com and get both reading practice and listening practice. With enough time, you’ll find that your reading and writing skills improve as well.

Ariel Goodbody has a strong background in linguistics and language acquisition, and they base the podcast on Stephen Krashen’s theory of comprehensible input. Ariel changes the level of grammar to suit each level, but prioritise comprehension and good storytelling over anything else. Vocabulary is described using paraphrase, cultural references, pictures, intonation and sound effects. British culture, especially English culture, is naturally introduced throughout the episodes.

Ariel also has experience in theatre, and treats every episode like an audiobook performance. With character voices, dramatic timing and a range of accents, adults and kids alike will soon forget that they’re ‘learning’ at all!

Some of the most well-known stories from the podcast are: the Doggo and Kitty stories, Grimm Brothers’ Fairy Tales, The Very Hungry Dragon, Sleeping Beauty, The Perfect Pet, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Why Blood is Red, Saint George and the Dragon and Pioneers of the Continuum. Many stories are adapted from famous authors, such as Edgar Allan Poe, Hans Christian Andersen, Isaac Asimov, Josef Čapek, Margery Williams and Ryuunosuke Akutagawa.

Ariel studied linguistics at the University of Cambridge and started teaching in 2018. As a language teacher, they use comprehensible input techniques such as TPRS and story listening. In 2021 they published a series of graded readers. These easy readers allow fans to get their favourite stories in a physical format.

In this episode of Easy Stories in English, host Ariel Goodbody discusses the concept of ''normal people problems'' as opposed to more serious issues, drawing on his own experiences of moving to London and finding his community. Ariel reflects on his challenging past, including changing gender twice and dealing with identity crisis, while contrasting these with his current ''normal'' problems such as itchy back due to hard water, adjusting to a slower pace in relationships, and struggling to find good cider in London. He also addresses the dynamics of friendship when one is thriving and the other is not, and invites listeners to share their own ''small fish'' problems on the show''s website and YouTube channel.

Get the transcript here: https://www.levelupenglish.school/podcast213/
Here are the key lessons from the episode:

There is no “100%” in language learning

It’s not easy to set specific in language learning

Students often reach a level of fluency before they realise it

There are many factors that affect learning speed (focus, your mind, your free time, etc)

If you focus on “when” and “how long”, you will never enjoy the journey.

If you don’t enjoy the process of learning, you will probably learn more slowly.

The process of learning is always much longer than the achievement of having learnt something. Focus on enjoying the longer one, because that is your life.

Hello everyone! It’s me, Ariel Goodbody, here with an exciting announcement.
You’ve probably noticed that there are advertisements during episodes of the podcast now, and if you’re paying close attention, you will have seen that I’m not making new content on Patreon anymore.
That’s because I’m starting Easy Stories in English Premium. Easy Stories in English Premium is a way to get all the episodes of the podcast without adverts, as well as bonus episodes from me.
So why have I decided to do this? Well, having adverts on the podcast helps me do things like buy food and clothes, which I hear are quite important. But I understand that not everyone wants to hear adverts, and many people prefer to support in a more direct way. Also, it lets me give you all something ‘extra special’ – that’s what premium means, by the way, ‘extra special’. The bonus episodes are my way of saying thank you for supporting me.
And I’m really excited about these new episodes. At the moment, I’m working on an episode about a recent holiday I took in Cornwall, and I interview my girlfriend Artoria as part of it. I also want to talk to you, my listeners, and record the conversations. So if you think you’ve got a star inside you, or you’d just enjoy having a chat with me on Zoom, this is your opportunity.
On Patreon, I experimented with all kinds of bonus content, but it wasn’t an easy platform to use. With Easy Stories in English Premium it’s much easier. As soon as you sign up you’ll get your own podcast feed – that’s the list of episodes – without adverts and with bonus episodes.
To sign up, go to EasyStoriesInEnglish.com/Support and use the code ‘easy’ to get your first month free. If you’re listening on Apple Podcasts, just go to the top of the feed and click ‘Try Free’!
The Patreon isn’t disappearing, by the way – you can join it to get access to the archive of all the content I made for it – that’s exercises for old episodes, bonus podcasts, stories and so on. But I won’t be making any new content there.
Thank you to everyone for listening, thank you to people who have supported me on Patreon, and I look forward to seeing you all on the Easy Stories in English Premium podcast feed! One more time, because I know it’s easy to forget how links are spelled, go to EasyStoriesInEnglish.com/Support and use the code ‘easy’ to get your first month free. Thank you so much!

The year is 2039
A group of scientists, linguists and historians have invented a time travel machine.
Each can return to a place and time, but only for one hour.
Some choose to go back to change the course of world history, while others go back to a period in their personal lives.
One even travels to the future.
It doesn’t quite go as planned…
===
A few weeks ago I interviewed Alastair, who led the Pioneers of the Continuum project, and today I''m so excited to share with you my episode! You can find all the episodes on the Leonardo English website, or on your podcast app.

Transcript

Welcome to Easy Stories in English, the podcast that will take your English from OK to Good, and from Good to Great.
I am not Ariel Goodbody. I''m Ariel''s friend, John. I''m recording this message for Ariel, because he''s unable to speak at the moment.
So here’s what Ariel has to say:
‘Hello, everyone. Some of you may know that I’m autistic. I talked about it earlier this year, when I did the pre-intermediate version of The Little Frog with the Big Mouth.
‘Basically, it means that my brain works a bit differently to most people’s. I am more sensitive to bright lights, loud sounds and strong smells. I don’t talk or act like most people do, so I often mask. Masking is when an autistic person “puts on a mask”, basically pretends to be like everyone else.
‘Because of these things, being autistic can be very tiring. It’s very hard for us to just exist in the world, because the world is full of bright lights, loud sounds and strong smells, and people want us to pretend we’re different to who we actually are.
‘So often, when things are too difficult for us, we shut down. This is when your body says, “No more!” Sometimes, it just means being alone in a room for a long time and resting.
‘But this year, I’ve been having more serious shutdowns. I’ve started going non-verbal—losing the ability to speak. As I’m writing this message, I’ve been non-verbal for 12 days. As well as this, I’ve also had movement difficulties, and I can’t easily do lots of things that I was able to do before, like travelling or shopping.
‘I’m telling you all this because, obviously, if I can’t talk, I can’t record Easy Stories in English. I really hate not being able to do the podcast, but right now, my body needs to rest. I don’t know how long it will be for, and to be honest, I don’t know how reliable my voice will be in the future. I’ve done some research into what’s happening to me, and I seem to have a health problem called autistic catatonia. There isn’t much research on it, and it’s difficult to treat, but I’m trying my best.
‘I want to thank you all for your support. I already talked about this on Patreon and in my email newsletter, and so many of you sent kind messages. I’m sorry I couldn’t respond to them all. I have found it very hard to keep up with emails.
‘So, for now, I will have to take a break from the podcast. Hopefully, I’ll be able to start again in the new year. I hope you all have wonderful holidays, if you do celebrate holidays around this time of year.
‘Thank you for listening, and hopefully I’ll see you soon.’
